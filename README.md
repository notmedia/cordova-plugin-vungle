The plugin.xml doesn't have ablity to put embedded frameworks to your project automaticly, so find VungleSDK.embeddedFramework in sources and drag & drop it to the directory into Xcode under Frameworks.

IMPORTANT: The VungleSDK.embeddedframework folder should be added as a group (yellow folder) and not as a reference (blue folder).
